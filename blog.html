                        <strong>Answer:</strong> The var keyword is the oldest way
                        of declaring variables in JavaScript and is supported by all browsers. The let and const
                        keywords are newer additions to the language and are not supported by older browsers.
                        If you need to support older browsers, you can use var instead of let or const. If you don’t
                        need to support older browsers, you can use let or const. If you want your variable to be
                        immutable, use const.
                        Another difference between var and let/const is that var variables are function-scoped,
                        while let and const variables are block-scoped.
                        This means that var variables are only available within the function they were declared in.
                        On the other hand, let and const variables are only available within the block they were
                        declared in.
                        So, to sum up, the main differences between var, let and const are:
                        var is function-scoped while let and const are block-scoped.
                        var variables can be reassigned while let and const variables can not.
                        var variables are declared using the var keyword while let and const variables are declared
                        using the let and const keywords respectively.
                        const variables are immutable while let and var variables are not.

                        what are the differences between regular function and arrow function?

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative
                        to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to the this, arguments,
                        super, or new.target keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill suited as methods, and
                        they cannot be used as constructors.
                        There are 3 subtle differences in regular functions and arrow functions in JavaScript.
                        No own this bindings
                        Arrow functions do not have their own this value. The value of this inside an arrow function
                        is always inherited from the enclosing scope.
                        Arrow functions do not have a arguments array
                        In JS arguments array in functions is a special object that can be used to get all the
                        arguments passed to the function. Similar to this, arrow functions do not have their own
                        binding to a arguments object, they are bound to arguments of enclosing scope.
                        Arrow functions are callable but not constructable
                        If a function is constructable, it can be called with new, i.e. new User(). If a function is
                        callable, it can be called without new (i.e. normal function call).
                        Functions created through function declarations / expressions are both constructable and
                        callable.
                        Arrow functions (and methods) are only callable. class constructors are only constructable.
                        If you are trying to call a non-callable function or to construct a non-constructable
                        function, you will get a runtime error.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong> .forEach() is great you need to execute a function for each
                        individual element in an array. Good practice is that you should use .forEach() when you
                        can’t use other array methods to accomplish your goal. I know this may sound vague, but
                        .forEach() is a generic tool, only use it when you can’t use a more specialized tool.

                        .map() when you want to transform elements in an array.

                        .filter() when you want to select a subset of multiple elements from an array.

                        .find() When you want to select a single element from an array.
